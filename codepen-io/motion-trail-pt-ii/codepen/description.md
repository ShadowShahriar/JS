Today is my CodePen anniversary! ðŸŽ‰

It has been an incredible year for me on CodePen. I feel so lucky to be a part of this charming community. Thanks, CodePen Team!

For this occasion, I have revisited my [first pen](https://codepen.io/shadow-scientist/pen/xxZJyXo) and produced it in a new way. Hence, I like to call it part II.

As the title suggests, this pen shows a motion trail effect build with `DIV`s. It uses Perlin noise to float around the screen. Also, there are some fancy toggles to customize the trail with shadow, depth, or to make it glow on a dark surface. They are located at the top-right corner.

The animation might be slow or worse based on your hardware because it runs on the CPU. I have discussed the issue [here](https://github.com/ShadowShahriar/JS/issues/2). From my observations, it performed better in Chrome v90.0.4430.93 in an x64-based processor.

Well, do you read these descriptions? If you do, thank you. You probably know I have been inconsistent on CodePen due to my exams and curricular activities. However, I will be investigating more time to build such pens frequently. So, stick around.

Everything was prepared within a short amount of time. So, there might be some flaws. But there is always room for improvement. Let me know your thoughts on this one ðŸ˜„
